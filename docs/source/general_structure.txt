General Structure
=================

SugarPy is comprised by a  **run** and a **results** class.
The run class includes all major functions to identify glycopeptides
from IS-CID mass spectrometry measurements, while the results class
can be used to generate different output files.


Run
---

The main functionalities of the SugarPy :ref:`run<sprun>` class include

    #. parsing protein database search result files to extract peptide sequences, retention times, etc.
    #. building all theoretical combinations for a set of peptide sequences, monosaccharides and a given glycan length
    #. searching MS1 spectra for isotope envelopes of all theoretical glycopeptides (using `pyQms`_)
    #. reassambling intact glycopeptides by combining subtrees, calculating SugarPy scores, etc.

Results
-------

A variety of output files can be generated using the SugarPy :ref:`results<spresults>` class, including

    #. output .csv file
    #. glycopeptide elution profiles
    #. annotated spectra

Furthermore, the results class can be used to validate identified glycopeptides
through non-IS-fragmenting MS runs. The corresponding .mzML files can be searched
for glycopeptides on different levels

    #. isotope envelope on MS1 level
    #. selection for fragmentation by HCD
    #. presence of glycopeptide specific fragment ions on MS2 level
